# React Authentication App

This is a React-based authentication application with a mock API for user login and signup. It uses `react-router-dom` for routing and includes features such as protected routes and a simulated backend for authentication.
In Analytics, it shows totalUsers which are remaining after deleted and if we filter it, it shows totalUsers as the filtered Users.
I have used 50 users in db.json as mock API out of which 
25 are active
25 are inactive 

## Features

- Login and Signup functionality with a mock API.
- Protected routes to secure access to certain pages (e.g., Dashboard, Analytics).
- Responsive design with a modern UI.
- State management for user authentication.
